### [Available here!](https://nrholm1.github.io/micro-todo/)

A minimal, keyboard-centric todo list manager with a small memory footprint. 

All tasks are stored locally (no server required), and itâ€™s designed to be navigated and edited primarily via the keyboard.

## Basic Usage
- **Add a Main Task**: Press `n` (opens a blank task in Edit mode).
- **Navigate** tasks using the arrow keys.
- **Press Enter** on a highlighted task to edit its description/deadline.
- **Press +** to add a subtask (or a sibling sub-subtask if already at level 2).
- **Toggle Completion** with `c`.
- **Delete** with `d` (asks for confirmation).
- **Undo Last Delete** with `Cmd+Z` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Z` (Windows/Linux).
- **Exit Edit Mode** with the `Escape` key.
